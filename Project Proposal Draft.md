# TaskTrack: An Assignment Tracker App

<br>

## Project Title
**TaskTrack: An Assignment Tracker App** <br> – A simple student tool designed to track assignments, organize due dates, and send reminders for upcoming deadlines.  

<br>

## Problem Statement
Many students struggle to keep track of multiple assignments and deadlines, which often leads to late submissions, missed opportunities to improve grades, and increased stress caused by poor organization.  
Without proper reminders or a clear system, it is easy to forget tasks or manage time poorly.  
There is a need for a tool that organizes subjects and due dates while reminding students of upcoming deadlines.  

<br>

## Project Objectives
- Help students improve time management by keeping track of all their assignments in one place.  
- Provide an organized system where tasks are automatically sorted by urgency.  
- Remind students of deadlines to avoid late submissions.  
- Reduce stress and procrastination by giving a clear view of what tasks are due soon.  

<br>

## Planned Features
- **Add and Manage Assignments**  
  Students can input subject name, task description, and due date.  
- **Automatic Deadline Sorting**  
  Tasks are automatically arranged by due date so the most urgent ones are shown first.  
- **Deadline Reminders**  
  Notifications will alert students if a due date is close (e.g., within 2 days).  
- **Local Storage for Data**  
  Assignments are saved locally so they remain available even after restarting the program.  
- **User-Friendly Design**  
  Clean, minimal, and easy-to-navigate interface made for student needs.

## Planned Inputs and Outputs

**Inputs (provided by the user):**  
- Subject: *e.g., “Computer Science”*  
- Task: *e.g., “CS-2 Project Proposal”*  
- Due Date: *e.g., “2025-09-30”*  

**Outputs (generated by the system):**  
- A list of assignments sorted by due date  
- Days left until each deadline  
- Reminders for assignments due within 2 days

## Logic Plan (Pseudocode)

```pseudocode
START PROGRAM

CREATE an empty list called Assignments

FUNCTION Add_Assignment
    PROMPT user for Subject Name
    PROMPT user for Task Description
    PROMPT user for Due Date (format: YYYY-MM-DD)
    CONVERT Due Date into a date object
    STORE {Subject, Task, Due Date} in Assignments list
    CALL Sort_Assignments
END FUNCTION

FUNCTION Sort_Assignments
    SORT Assignments list by Due Date in ascending order
END FUNCTION

FUNCTION Show_Assignments
    GET today’s date
    FOR each Assignment in Assignments list
        CALCULATE Days_Left = Due Date - Today
        DISPLAY Subject, Task, Due Date, and Days_Left
    END FOR
END FUNCTION

FUNCTION Reminder_Check
    GET today’s date
    FOR each Assignment in Assignments list
        CALCULATE Days_Left = Due Date - Today
        IF Days_Left <= 2 THEN
            DISPLAY "Reminder: Assignment due soon → " + Subject + " - " + Task
        END IF
    END FOR
END FUNCTION

FUNCTION Save_Data
    WRITE Assignments list to a local file
END FUNCTION

FUNCTION Load_Data
    IF saved file exists THEN
        READ Assignments list from the file
    ELSE
        KEEP Assignments list empty
END FUNCTION

REPEAT
    DISPLAY Menu Options:
        1 – Add New Assignment
        2 – Show All Assignments
        3 – Check Reminders
        4 – Exit Program
    PROMPT user for choice

    IF choice = 1 THEN
        CALL Add_Assignment
        CALL Save_Data
    ELSE IF choice = 2 THEN
        CALL Show_Assignments
    ELSE IF choice = 3 THEN
        CALL Reminder_Check
    ELSE IF choice = 4 THEN
        CALL Save_Data
        EXIT PROGRAM
    ELSE
        DISPLAY "Invalid choice. Try again."
UNTIL user chooses Exit

END PROGRAM
